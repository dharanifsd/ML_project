## Introduction
In this project, we analyze hostel expenditure data to develop predictive models that can assist in financial planning and budgeting for hostel management. The project utilizes Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, and Gradio for data analysis, visualization, modeling, and deployment.

## Data Overview
The dataset used in this project contains information about hostel expenditure, income, expenses, and other relevant factors. It includes features such as Girls_hostel, Boys_hostel, Total_strength, Income, Total_expenditure, Date, and more.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
We conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the dataset. This includes visualizations such as line plots, scatter plots, histograms, and correlation matrices to understand the relationships between different variables.

## Data Preprocessing
Before building machine learning models, we preprocess the data by handling missing values, converting date formats, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features. This ensures that the data is suitable for modeling.

## Model Building
We build machine learning models, including linear regression and decision tree regression, to predict hostel expenditure based on input variables. We train the models using the preprocessed data and evaluate their performance using appropriate metrics.

## Evaluation
We evaluate the performance of the trained models using metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), R-squared score, and visualizations of predicted vs. actual expenditure. This helps us assess the accuracy and reliability of the models.

## Deployment
The predictive model is deployed using Gradio, allowing users to input a date in YYYY-MM-DD format to predict hostel expenditure and calculate individual expenditures based on predefined coefficients.

## Future Work
Future enhancements to the project may include improving model performance, exploring additional features, optimizing deployment for scalability, and incorporating user feedback for refinement.
