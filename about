This project analyzes hostel expenditure data to develop predictive models for forecasting future expenditure. It leverages Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, and Gradio for data analysis, visualization, modeling, and deployment. Additionally, Intel accelerators are utilized for optimizing the performance of machine learning algorithms. The code includes data loading, exploratory data analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, model building (using linear regression and decision tree regression), evaluation, and deployment using Gradio for interactive prediction. The project aims to assist hostel management in financial planning and budgeting by providing accurate expenditure forecasts based on historical data.
